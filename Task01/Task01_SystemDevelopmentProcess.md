Task 1 – System Development Steps, Process, and Purpose for an Online Quiz System

Planning / Feasibility StudyProcess: Identify the need for the system, define project objectives, conduct technical, economic, operational, and schedule feasibility studies, estimate budget and timeline, perform initial risk assessment, obtain management approval.
Purpose: To determine whether the online quiz system is viable, beneficial, and worth investing resources in before any detailed work begins.


Requirements Analysis and SpecificationProcess: Conduct interviews, surveys, and workshops with stakeholders (teachers, students, administrators), elicit functional requirements (create/edit quizzes, timer, randomization, auto-grading, result sharing) and non-functional requirements (security, performance, mobile compatibility), document and get stakeholder approval in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
Purpose: To clearly define and agree on exactly what the system must do, forming a solid foundation and preventing costly changes later.


System DesignProcess: Create high-level architecture (e.g., client-server, MVC), detailed database design (Users, Quizzes, Questions, Answers, Results tables), UI/UX wireframes and prototypes, API design, security design (authentication, authorization, data encryption), and technical specifications in a Design Document Specification (DDS).
Purpose: To produce a complete blueprint showing how the system will be built to meet all requirements in a usable, scalable, and secure manner.


Implementation / CodingProcess: Set up the development environment, write front-end code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/React), back-end code (Java Spring Boot, Node.js, Python/Django, etc.), implement database, authentication, quiz logic, randomization, scoring, notifications, and integrate all components.
Purpose: To construct the actual working online quiz system according to the approved design.


TestingProcess: Perform unit testing, integration testing, system testing, end-to-end testing, performance/load testing, security testing, cross-browser testing, accessibility testing, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with real users.
Purpose: To verify that the system is correct, reliable, secure, performs well under load, and fully satisfies the specified requirements.


DeploymentProcess: Prepare production servers (AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc.), configure domain and SSL, migrate database and initial data, perform staged or full rollout, provide user training and documentation.
Purpose: To make the online quiz system live and accessible to end users in a controlled and stable manner.


MaintenanceProcess: Monitor system performance and logs, fix bugs, apply security patches, add new features (analytics, proctoring, more question types), perform regular backups and scaling as needed.
Purpose: To ensure the system remains operational, secure, and continuously improved throughout its lifecycle.
