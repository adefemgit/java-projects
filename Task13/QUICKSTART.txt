QUICK START GUIDE - Performance Testing

Step-by-Step Instructions for Running Performance Tests

Prerequisites Check

1. Verify Java 11 is installed:
   java -version
   
2. Install JMeter (if not already installed):
   macOS: brew install jmeter
   Linux: Download from https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
   
3. Verify JMeter installation:
   jmeter --version

Running the Test

Step 1: Start the Quiz Application
Open Terminal 1:

cd /Users/jnr/Documents/Sysdev_project
javac Main.java
java Main


Keep this terminal running. You should see:
"Server running at http://localhost:8080"

Step 2: Run Performance Test
Open Terminal 2:

cd /Users/jnr/Documents/Sysdev_project/Task13
./run_performance_test.sh


The script will:
- Check if server is running
- Clean previous results
- Execute the test with 1000 users over 5 minutes
- Generate HTML report
- Open the report in your browser

Step 3: Review Results
The HTML report will open automatically showing:
- Response time graphs
- Throughput metrics
- Error statistics
- Detailed performance data

Customizing the Test

Run with different user count:

./run_performance_test.sh -t 500


Run with different ramp-up time (in seconds):

./run_performance_test.sh -r 600


Run in GUI mode for test development:

./run_performance_test.sh -m gui


Combine options:

./run_performance_test.sh -t 2000 -r 600


Manual Execution (Without Script)

If you prefer to run JMeter manually:


cd /Users/jnr/Documents/Sysdev_project
jmeter -n -t Task13/performance/QuizLoadTest.jmx -l Task13/reports/results.jtl -e -o Task13/reports/html-report


Generating the Report

Step 1: Collect Test Results
- Open: Task13/reports/html-report/index.html
- Review all dashboard sections
- Take screenshots of key graphs

Step 2: Fill in the Report Template
- Open: Task13/reports/PERFORMANCE_TEST_REPORT_TEMPLATE.txt
- Replace all [INSERT] placeholders with actual data
- Add screenshots and analysis

Step 3: Convert to PDF
Options:
a) Microsoft Word: Copy content, format, export as PDF
b) Google Docs: Copy content, format, download as PDF
c) Pandoc: pandoc report.txt -o report.pdf
d) Online converter: Use markdown-to-pdf tool

Step 4: Upload to Shared Folder
- Save PDF as: Performance_Test_Report_[DATE].pdf
- Upload to: Performance_test_JMeter shared folder

Key Metrics to Extract from HTML Report

Dashboard Statistics Tab:
- Total requests
- Success rate
- Error rate
- Average response time
- Throughput (req/sec)

Charts Tab:
- Response Time Over Time graph
- Active Threads Over Time graph
- Transactions Per Second graph

Statistics Table:
- For each endpoint (/, /questions, /submit):
  * Average response time
  * 90th percentile
  * 95th percentile
  * Min/Max times
  * Error percentage

Understanding Results

Response Time Guidelines:
- Excellent: < 500ms average
- Good: 500-1000ms average
- Acceptable: 1000-2000ms average
- Poor: > 2000ms average

NFR Compliance:
- Target: < 2000ms (from Task05 requirements)
- Check 95th percentile is under 2000ms
- All requests should meet this threshold

Error Rate:
- Target: < 1% errors
- Any errors should be investigated
- Common errors: Connection refused, timeouts

Troubleshooting

Issue: "Server is NOT running"
Solution: Start Main.java in separate terminal

Issue: "JMeter is not installed"
Solution: Run "brew install jmeter"

Issue: Test takes too long
Solution: Reduce threads or ramp-up time for testing

Issue: High error rate
Solution: Check server logs, verify endpoints work manually

Issue: Cannot generate HTML report
Solution: Delete old reports folder and try again

Issue: Out of memory
Solution: Increase JMeter heap size:
export JVM_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx2048m"

Expected Timeline

- Server startup: 5 seconds
- Test ramp-up: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- Test execution: ~1-2 minutes
- Report generation: 10-30 seconds
- Total: Approximately 7-8 minutes

After the Test

1. Stop the Quiz server (Ctrl+C in Terminal 1)
2. Review HTML report thoroughly
3. Take screenshots of important graphs
4. Complete the report template
5. Generate PDF
6. Upload to shared folder
7. Commit results to GitHub
